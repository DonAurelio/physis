Translating Physis Programs
===========================

Physis source code can be translated to source code for different
types target platforms. The current version support the following
executions:  

- ref: sequential CPU execution
- mpi: MPI-based distributed memory CPU execution
- cuda: single-GPU CUDA execution
- mpi-cuda: MPI-based distributed memory GPU execution

To compile Physis code, use `physisc` command, which is located at
the <install-prefix>/bin directory, as follows:

    $ physisc --target test.c -I<install-prefix>/include
    
where `target` can be one of the supported platforms. More simply,
a utility shell scripts are provided for each platform, such as
`physisc-cuda`. So, the following translates test.c to cuda code:

     $ physisc-cuda test.c
     
The translated file is produced in the current working directory with its
name derived from the original file name and target. For example, in
the above case, a CUDA source file named `test.cuda.cu` will be
generated. 

Source code generated by Physis is ordinary code written in each
target-dependent language with libraries. It can be compiled to
executables by the common compilation steps for each target.
