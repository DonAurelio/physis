* Installation
- Prerequisites (Ubuntu package names)
  - Ubuntu
    - sun-java6 (JDK not just JRE)
    - libboost-all-dev
    - doxygen (optional)
  - Mac
    - Java developer package from http://connect.apple.com
    - Brew packages: boost, ghostscript
    - GNU libtool 
- Steps
  - (Git only) run build.sh
  - Linux only
    - set JAVA_HOME
    - set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include libjvm.so directory
      - e.g., export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/amd64/server:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  - Download the source
    - https://outreach.scidac.gov/frs/?group_id=24&release_id=212
    - rose-0.9.5a-without-EDG-11570.tar.gz
    - The download site appears to introduce a new package every week
      consistently. It's likely that they are automatically packaged
      by the site, and thus they may not be rigorously tested. In
      fact, 0.9.5a-without-EDG-11661 does not work on OSX.
  - unpack the source
  - mkdir build-directory
  - do configure in the build directory
    - --prefix=somewhere
    - --with-CXX_DEBUG="-g"
    - --with-CXX_WARNINGS="-Wall -Wno-deprecated"
    - --enable-cuda
    - --with-boost=/usr
      - need to be passed; probably a bug
  - make
    - Hint: use -j option to speed up compilation
  - make install
- Errors and workarounds
  - Installing librose.a fails
    - Edit the top-level libtool on the build directory so that the
      compiler_lib_search_path variable (located in the very end of
      the file) include the installation lib directory. 

* Usage
- Declaration modifier
  - Use SgDeclarationStatement::get_declarationModifier() to get
    SgDeclarationModifier 
  - SgDeclarationModifier::get_storageModifier() to
    getSgStorageModifier
  - Use SgStorageModifier::setStatic
- Do not insert statements and expressions while traversing. Already
  traversed nodes seem fine to edit, but editing remaining nodes
  results in backend errors.
* Questions
- SageInterface::lookupNamedTypeInParentScopes
  - The doxygen manual says it does bottom up search. What is the top
    of the stack? Is it the most inner scope? Or is it the root of the
    scope?

- frontend
  - Declared in roseSupport/utility_functions.h
